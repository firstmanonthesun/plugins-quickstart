  title: Codat Plugin
  description: |
    A plugin that allows the user to interrogate company data using ChatGPT. If the user doesn't specify which company they want, ask them first. 
    You can also provide them with a list of available companies. 
    Most operations can be called without a query string, and they will perform an open query and return an array of items or aggregated results. 
    If supplying a 'query' string, the following comparison operators are supported = != > < >= <= ~ (contains), 
    and they can be combined using logical operators && (AND) and || (OR), and curly braces for grouping of logical operations. 
    For example, "{totalAmount > 100 || totalAmount < 50} && status != paid". 
    Here is an example of a query using a string value "companyName=Sample Company".
    You can also provide an 'orderBy' string, which should be the name of the field to order by. Prefix the field name with - for descending order.
    You can also provide a 'pageSize' as a way of restricting the number of results. You should use this when asked for things such as "top 10 results".
